# Lid-Driven Cavity Simulation

This project simulates the classical lid-driven cavity problem in incompressible fluid dynamics based on the two-dimensional Navierâ€“Stokes equations.

## Contents

- **[HPC_Report_2.pdf](./HPC_Report_2.pdf)**  
  Explains the mathematical foundations and code implementation, and analyzes performance improvements after parallelization.

- **[ic.txt](./ic.txt)**  
  Contains the initial condition of the two-dimensional fluid field.

- **[out.txt](./out.txt)**  
  Contains the simulated fluid field results at the specified time.

## Usage

To run the project, open a terminal in the project directory and execute:

```bash
make run
